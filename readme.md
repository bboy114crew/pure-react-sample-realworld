# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### Pure React codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://quanla.github.io/pure-react-sample-realworld-pages/)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Pure React** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Pure React** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

# How it works

React itself as the framework of this system. Please stop thinking that React is only a view lib and not qualified as a framework. This system make heavy use of React component state and component lifecycle. Note that React mixins or React context are not used at all.

# Getting started

npm install
npm start
